Removed the ESLint plugins for [Cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-cypress), [Emotion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emotion/eslint-plugin), [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jest), [Next.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-next), [Playwright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-playwright), [Storybook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-storybook), and [Testing Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-testing-library) from the dependencies. Install the plugins as dev dependencies in your project. Foundry still enables and configures them automatically.
